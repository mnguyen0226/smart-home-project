# Smart Home Project - ECE 2804

## About the Project
This project simulates the autonomate and control home system with the goals to gain the ability to control remotely your connected home from your phone and computer. There are two versions:
- The simplified smart home.
- The advanced smart home.

## How does the advanced smart home work?
Here is the high level structure of the advanced version:

## How does the simplified smart home work?
Here is the high level structure of the simplified version:

There are 5 appliances:
- The Automated Night Light System contains a photoresistor and a LED. If there is no light, the LED will turn on.
- The Fire Alarm System contains a speaker, an amplifier, and a button. When the owner presses the button then a recorded message
will be processed by the amplifier which then delivers the message to the speaker.
- The Weather Station + AC Unit contains a temperature sensor and an LED which represents the AC Unit. The weather station will take
real-time temperature, and if the temperature in F goes above 67F, then the LED (AC Unit) is on. The
temperature will constantly be updated on the LCD and MIT App. 
The Intruder Detection System contains a motion sensor and a buzzer. If a motion is detected, then the buzzer will make buzzing noise, the LCD asks the user to call 911, and the MIT App will alert the owner of the theftâ€™s moving and stopping time.
- The Indoor Lights contains a Bluetooth and an LED (indoor light). The LED on/off state will be controlled via MIT app,
Bluetooth, and Arduino Uno.
## How does the MIT phone app work?
